# ToyZoid

ToyZoid is a tool to assist parents in finding other local parents in order to exchange children's toys.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

npm run seed
npm run develop
```

Runs the app in the development mode. http://localhost:3000 will open automatically in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

## Roadmap

Looking forward, the team would like to add localization elements to make it easier to connect locally, improve moderation tools, and comment replies.
